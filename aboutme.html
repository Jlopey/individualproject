    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><img src="jaheedlopez.jpg" alt="Jaheed Lopez" width="152" height="132" style="float:left; margin-right:50px">
My name is Jaheed Lopez, and I am pursuing my Associate's degree in Information Technology. I graduated from St. Benedict R.C. School on June 26, 2017. I then went to Toledo Community College to obtain my high school diploma, which I received on June 9, 2021.
        After graduating from high school, I wasn't keen on further education, so I began working as a fisherman. I spent two years working alongside my father before deciding to return to school, motivated by my passion for football. I have always aspired to be a professional football player. I joined a local team in Toledo District, where I performed well and was recommended for a football scholarship. I pursued that opportunity and am currently in my third semester at university.</p>
